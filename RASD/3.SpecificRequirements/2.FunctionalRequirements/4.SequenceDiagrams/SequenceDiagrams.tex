\subsection{Sequence Diagrams\label{sect:3.2.4}}

In the following Sequence Diagrams, most of the Use Cases described in detail in subsection \ref{sect:3.2.3} are shown, except for the Use Cases {U\subs{1}}, {U\subs{2}} and {U\subs{3}}, representing respectively the \ic{User} sign up, the \ic{User} login and the \ic{Municipality} login phases, for simplicity reasons, as they are trivial.\\
Still, the login process is here shown in all the Sequence Diagrams which refer to the Use Cases requiring it as first task, to highlight that all those Use Cases require it, but {U\subs{8a}}.\\
