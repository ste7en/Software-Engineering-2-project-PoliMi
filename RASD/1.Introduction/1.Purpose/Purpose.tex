Its purpose is to analyze the requirements that will lay the foundations of application services, to specify the application domain, the entities involved and their relationship, to clearly explain the objectives, the constraints and the features that are going to be implemented. \newline
SafeStreets is a crowd-sourced application that intends to provide users with the possibility to notify authorities when traffic violations occur, and in particular parking violations. The application allows users to send pictures of violations, including their date, time, and position, to authorities.
