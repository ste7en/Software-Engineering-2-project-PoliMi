	\section{User Characteristics}

		\paragraph{Users:}
		People having a smartphone with Internet connection and willing to report a \ic{Traffic violation} which has occurred. 
		\paragraph{Municipality:}
		Authorities having the possibility to receive a \ic{User report notification} when a \ic{User report} is received by SafeStreets, in order to evaluate it and, eventually, generate \ic{Traffic tickets}. They can evaluate reports without being physically present and see all the details about a specific \ic{User report}. This also allow them to motivate any possible \ic{User report} discarded. The \ic{Municipality} visualizes, then, all the \ic{Possible intervention} suggested by SafeStreets (e.g. add a barrier between the bike lane and the part of the road for motorized vehicles to prevent unsafe parking â€¦).
