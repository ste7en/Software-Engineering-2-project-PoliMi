	\subsection{Model-View-Controller\label{subsect:2.6.3}}
	The chosen design pattern for mobile and web applications implementations is the Model-View-Controller (MVC), which separates an application into three interconnected elements, each one realizing a functionality. \\

	While the Controller updates the View, the Model represents a thin data manager, where a small cache of data previously downloaded from the server are temporary stored, manipulated and updated by the Controller. \\
	
	This pattern, from a Software Engineering point of view, guarantees the reusability of code and parallel development.

	The picture above models the class diagram of clients' applications in our system, with a Controller that communicates with the Web Server through an API Manager class, responsible of handling asynchronous connections and data decoding.
