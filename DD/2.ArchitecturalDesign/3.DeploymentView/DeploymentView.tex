\section{Deployment View\label{sect:2.3}}

The following section aims at describing the deployment diagram of the \ic{System to be}, from a physical point of view with details on how both hardware and software will be implemented and delivered.

A load balancer is at the system's core, to balance the calls from clients to servers, which will be the busy ones. \ All servers communicate each other and with the database through a TCP/IP protocol.

To manage the situation of high workload and ensure both \ic{reliability} and \ic{availability}, the server architecture has been split in several machines: three Web Servers will handle the HTTP calls and from a minimum of 3 to a maximum of 6 machines will host and replicate the Application Server. \
In order to understand better the normal work load of the system, a \ic{load testing} analysis will be performed once finished the implementation phase, with a testing tool like \ic{Apache JMeter}. \\\\
For availability purposes, also the load balancers have been duplicated with an IaaS management of internal and external IP addresses of the machines. \\\\
