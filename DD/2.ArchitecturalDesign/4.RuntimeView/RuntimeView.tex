\section{Runtime View\label{sect:2.4}}

In this section the dynamic behaviour of the system is described, with the help of some Sequence Diagrams concerning the most relevant use cases.
Most of the use cases require, as first task, the authentication of \ic{User} or \ic{Municipality}, in particular, the only case in which the authentication phase is not required is the generation of the \ic{Possible interventions} by SafeStreets, which is automotically performed periodically (Diagram U8.a). For this reason, the authentication process is not shown in the following Diagrams.
