\section{Runtime View\label{sect:2.4}}

In this section the dynamic behaviour of the system is described, with the help of some Sequence Diagrams concerning the most relevant use cases.\\

In the Sequence Diagram U\subs{4}, once the \ic{User report} is sent by the \ic{User}, its Digital signature is generated by the Authentication Manager using data from the Authentication DB, and then stored with the correspondent \ic{User report} in the Reports DB; in the Sequence Diagram U\subs{5}, instead, before returnig to the \ic{Municipality} the selected \ic{User report}, the Digital signature is checked by the Authentication Manager, using data from the Authentication DB.\\
These processes are executed in order to guarantee the integrity of the \ic{User report} chain of custody (subsection \ref{2.7.2}).\\

In the Sequence Diagram U\subs{8a}, the described process is periodically executed to update the Accidents in the Accidents DB, retrieving only the latest ones from the Municipality IT, in order to optimize the database management.\\

Furthermore, most of the use cases require, as first task, the authentication of \ic{User} or \ic{Municipality}; the only case in which the authentication phase is not required is the generation of the \ic{Possible interventions} by SafeStreets, which is automatically performed periodically (more details in Sequence Diagram U\subs{8a}). For this reason, the authentication process is not shown in the following Diagrams.
