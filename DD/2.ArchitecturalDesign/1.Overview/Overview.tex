The figure above represents an high-level description of the main components which constitute the system-to-be. They are organized in a 4-tiers architecture, in particular:
\begin{description}
	\item [Browser]: is the Presentation tier for the \ic{Municipality} Browser, it communicates with the Web Server;
	\item [Mobile application]: is the Presentation tier for the \ic{User} Mobile Application, it communicates with the Web Server;
	\item [Web Server]: represents the Service tier, it communicates with the \ic{Municipality} Browser and with the Mobile Application on one hand (i.e. the Presentation tier) and with the components of the Application Server on the other (i.e. the Business logic tier);
	\item [Application Server]: represents the Business logic tier of the system, it communicates with the Web Server on one hand and with the Database tier on the other; 
	\item [Data Access Objects and Database]: represent the Database tier of the system; the Database communicates with the Business tier through the Data Access Objects (DAO).
\end{description}
In particular, Web Server and Application Server have been separated mainly for security reasons.
Further details about the architectural choices can be found in the sections \ref{sect:2.6} and \ref{sect:2.7}.
