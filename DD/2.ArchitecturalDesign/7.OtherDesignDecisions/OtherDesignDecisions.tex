\subsection{User Authentication and Password Storing\label{2.7.1}}
In order to guarantee the confidentiality of \ic{Users'} and \ic{Municipalities'} data, the access to the system is guaranteed by entering a personal identifier and a password. For \ic{Users}, the personal identifier coincides with the email address inserted during the registration phase. \\

For each registered entity, their access passwords are hashed using a SHA512 algorithm and then saved in the database.

\subsection{User report Chain of Custody\label{2.7.2}}
\ic{User reports} constitutes sensitive data because they contain license plates' numbers, GPS data and, in general, information about traffic violations that will be sent to a \ic{Municipality}. To ensure that these information won't be altered, a digital signature mechanism has been implemented to realize the chain of custody. \\

When a \ic{User} sends his \ic{User report} to the application server, a hash function on its data and \ic{User} entity is computed and stored in the same database of the report. At retrieval time, the same function is computed and the values are checked to ensure that no alterations occurred.
