\chapter{Requirements Traceability}
\thispagestyle{fancy}

In this section, the mapping between the DD components and RASD functional requirements is shown. The requirements are grouped by the components which are used to satisfy them, also highlighting the specific functionality of the components themselves.\\

In the provided mapping, the "Router" component is not mentioned for simplicity reasons, but clearly it is directly or indirectly connected to the fulfillment of the majority of the system functionalities, as it routes to the right component every message coming from the Web Application side.
